# Week 1 : Android Challenge

Here I developed my first Android app in Kotlin a *Simple Calculator* with the help of *'how to'* [article](https://medium.com/@olajhidey/how-to-build-a-simple-calculator-app-in-android-studio-using-kotlin-9b942c2d1f15)

## What I learnt :
  - Function in Kotlin 
  - variables in Kotlin
  - NPE in Kotlin
  - Little bit about OOPs in kotlin

## Future Scope :
  Due to time constrint, I made a little buggy Android apps (well this is my first android app in Kotlin)
  - [ ] Improve the User Interface
  - [ ] Add Splash Screen
  - [ ] Add unit/currency/distance etc converters
  - [ ] Optimize the operations, so the overflow would not occur
